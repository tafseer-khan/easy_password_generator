The purpose of this Website is to generate a password based off of the users' desired length and contents.
When first entering the page there will be a box with dotted line border with text "Your Secure Password" and a red button underneath.
Once pressing the red button you will be given a series of dialogs introducing the website, and then prompting the user to choose their desired contents.
By default the password will include lower case letters.
If the user chooses to not include any other character types an error message will be displayed and the user will be prompted again to choose at least one character type.
Once character types have been chosen and accepted the user will be required to choose their password length. 
If the user chooses a password length less than 8 characters, more than 128 characters, or a non integer value an error message will be displayed which will repromt the user to use numberical values between 8 and 128 characters. 
Once all prompts have been completed the "Your Secure Password" text will be replaced with your random password. 
Once this has been displayed the user is allowed to highlight, and copy this value.
